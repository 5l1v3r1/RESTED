**RESTED** is a new take on REST clients for browsers.
It is designed to be easy to use to let you work as effective as possible.
It features all the most commonly used HTTP methods, setting headers, beautiful themes,
saving requests in your browser, and more.

Since this is a relatively new project, I am also happy to announce that
it is also awesomely easy to contribute to the project! Everything is
javascript and html, so come join! All contributions welcome.

## The state of the project

**RESTED** is currently being rewritten to React.js and Redux.

Rewriting it is a large endeavour, will take a long time, and depending on
several factors may or may not actually see completion. If you wish to help out,
see the [next](https://github.com/esphen/RESTED/tree/next)
branch for details.
